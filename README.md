**Roadelse synchronization universe**

+ provide several tools for improving sync-relative affairs during daily work

1. **jsync**: project-level sync tool, a wrapper for rsync but using pre-configured hosts & paths to avoid typing explicit paths

2. **robsys**: used to operate files & directories among local directory and corresponding cloud-sync dirs. Fixed for my custom r.o.b.s. distributed project FS
