# reSync readme

**Roadelse synchronization universe**

+ provide several tools for improving sync-relative affairs during daily work

1. **jsync**: project-level sync tool, a wrapper for rsync but using pre-configured hosts & paths to avoid typing explicit paths

2. **robsys**: (usage limited) used to operate files & directories among local directory and corresponding cloud-sync dirs (e.g., Onedrive and Baidusync is considered here). Desgined for my custom r.o.b.s. distributed project file structure

+ See detailed description and usage in each directory.
